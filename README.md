**X-Playing Card** will transform into a **special joker** once you play and score it as **High Card** as your **first hand of the round**.

At the end of the round, it will **transform** back to the **X-Playing Card** so you can decide to PLAY something else next round! (with a few exceptions!)

**X-Playing Joker** on the other hand will convert regular playing cards into **X-Playing Cards** when needed!
