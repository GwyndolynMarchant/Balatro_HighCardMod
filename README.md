# X-Playing Deck and X-Playing Joker

Once you install the mod, you will see a new deck called *X-Playing Deck*, this deck will have all 52 regular poker cards and a legendary joker at the beginning of the run:

This joker will **transform** into a X-Playing Card joker once you play your first hand of the round. Whichever hand you played, it will transfer (the corresponding High Card or X-Hand). 

At the end of the round, it will transform back to X-Playing Joker so you can decide to **PLAY** something else next round!
